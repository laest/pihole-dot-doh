Official pihole 6 beta docker with both DoT (DNS over TLS), DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and unbound clients. Don't browse the web securely and yet still send your DNS queries in plain text!

## Usage:

For docker parameters, refer to [official pihole docker readme](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables). 

Below is an docker compose example.

```
version: '3.0'

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole6-dot-doh
    image: laest/pihole6-dot-doh:latest
    hostname: pihole
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "82:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'Europe/Berlin'
      #WEBPASSWORD: 'password'
      PIHOLE_DNS_: '127.1.1.1#5153;127.2.2.2#5253'
      #INTERFACE: 'br0'
      FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4: '<IP of the docker host>'
      FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV6: ''
      IPv6: 'False'
      DNSMASQ_LISTENING: 'all'
      # Use boxed layout (helpful when working on large screens)
      #WEBUI BOXED LAYOUT: 'boxed'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './pihole/:/etc/pihole/'
      - './dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
      - './config/:/config'
      - './log/pihole/:/var/log/pihole
      #Unbound Log if you need it
      #- './log/unbound/:/var/log/unbound
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Unbound:

Unbound has been integrated into the image. Unbound can be used as the only upstream dns server for pihole, while unbound itself has been pre-configured to use stubby and cloudflared as its upstream dns servers.

#### Migrate to Unbound:
To use unbound instead of cloudflared and stubby just replace the "Pihole_DNS_" variable with "127.0.0.1#5335".

If you want to change the upstream dns servers for unbound just edit the "forward-records.conf" file in your "/config" mount and comment-out (add a # infront of the "forward-addr") the line and remove the comment for any other dns server like quad9.

#### Configure logging for Unbound
By default logging for unbound has been disabled and routed to "/dev/null". This can be changed to "/var/log/unbound/unbound.log" in the "unbound.conf" file in your "/config" mount. After a restart of the container the log should be viewable with the command "docker exec Pihole-DoT-DoH tail -f /var/log/unbound/unbound.log" from the host.

If no logs are collected you might need to enable "log-queries" in the "unbound.conf" file or need to increase the "verbosity"-level in the "unbound.conf" file. If you made sure unbound is running, you should disable logging again and redirect the logfile to "/dev/null" again!

### Notes:

- Remember to set pihole env PIHOLE_DNS_ to use the DoH / DoT / Unbound IP below. If PIHOLE_DNS_ is NOT set, Pihole will use a non-encrypted service.
  - DoH service (cloudflared) runs at 127.1.1.1#5153. Uses cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1) by default
  - DoT service (stubby) runs at 127.2.2.2#5253. Uses google (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) by default
  - Unbound service run at 127.0.0.1#5335
- In addition to the 2 official paths, you can also map container /config to expose configuration yml files for cloudflared (cloudflared.yml) and stubby (stubby.yml).
  - Edit these files to add / remove services as you wish. The flexibility is yours.
- Credits:
  - Pihole base image is the official [pihole/pihole:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole/tags?page=1&name=latest)
  - Cloudflared client was obtained from [official site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation#linux)
  - Stubby is a standard debian package
  - doh and dot was based from https://github.com/testdasi/pihole-dot-doh
  - Joly0 for the unbound integration (https://github.com/Joly0)
  - update since other container was falling behind version

### Important Changes:

Some variables for the example docker compose has been updated reflecting changes of the pi-hole docker container.
Changes are:
- "DNS1" and "DNS1" has been replaced with the single variable "PIHOLE_DNS_". You can add multiple dns servers here, separated by a semicolon ;
- "ServerIP" has been replaced with "FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4"
- "ServerIPv6" has been replaced with "FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV6"
- Variable "WEBUI BOXED LAYOUT" with the value "boxed" has been added as an optional variable, as its suggested by the upstream pi-hole docker container as its helpful if you open pi-hole on a large screens
